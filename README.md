TWEET RETRIEVER
===============
**DEPRECATED:** Twitter now has it's own [tweet archive](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160) available for users so this is probably no longer necessary.

This script retrieves the last 3200 tweets from an account using OAuth.

Requirements
------------
Requires you to setup an application and fill-in a consumer token/secret as well as a generated access token/secret (Twitter makes this easy by generating one for you once you have your application setup).

License
------------
